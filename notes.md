### Setup 

Java is a ligh level language which is platform independent. It is then coverted into low level language.

platform independent means we have hardware which is run by OS. it need to make compatibilty with OS to run. C was also platform independent. 

Java will run on OS it will compatible on every OS. js code was created which is converted into bytecode, which will be compatible with all the OS.

hardware 
    OS
        JVM

it makes an agreement with the OS that whenever it will get any javacode file, it will not be executed it's component will exist known as JVM (Java virtual machine).

it does not exist physically instead virtually, now the jvm will read every bytecode. JVM also has a component inside it which is called JRE which run each code of java. Java runtime environement.

to run javacode or run java application we need software JRE.

to use java programe we need  JDK and JRE
interpreter and compiler are also required for this.

# steps to create file

1. create a .java file
2. it will convert into bytecode. its extention will be .class.
3. compiler for java is javac.
4. interpreter java.
5. it have multiple compiler and interpreter.
6. it will converted into machine code.
7. from machine code it will converted on our machine.
8. then execute on our machine in our ram where there will no physical file will be created instead evem if it is created it will be deleted automatically.

### Common Java Terms

- **JDK**: Java Development Kit - Tools needed for Java development
- **JRE**: Java Runtime Environment - Required to run Java applications
- **JVM**: Java Virtual Machine - Executes Java bytecode
- **Bytecode**: Intermediate code (.class files) that runs on JVM
- **Source Code**: Original Java code (.java files)

### Installation Requirements

1. Download and install JDK
2. Set JAVA_HOME environment variable
3. Add Java to system PATH
4. Verify installation with `java -version`
